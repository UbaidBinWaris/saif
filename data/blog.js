      <h3>Audit Logging</h3>
      <p>Log all API interactions for security monitoring and compliance requirements. Include timestamps, user identifiers, and request/response data.</p>
      
      <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
      
      <h3>Connection Pooling</h3>
      <p>Reuse HTTP connections to reduce overhead and improve performance, especially for high-frequency API calls.</p>
      
      <h3>Parallel Processing</h3>
      <p>When possible, make API calls in parallel rather than sequentially. This significantly reduces total processing time.</p>
      
      <h3>Response Caching</h3>
      <p>Implement intelligent caching strategies based on data freshness requirements and API costs.</p>
      
      <h2>Monitoring and Observability</h2>
      
      <p>Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining healthy API integrations:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Response time tracking:</strong> Monitor API response times</li>
